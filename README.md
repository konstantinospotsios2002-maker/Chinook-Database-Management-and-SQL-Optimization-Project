# Chinook-Database-Management-and-SQL-Optimization-Project
A project using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio focused on querying, optimizing, and managing the Chinook database through SQL queries, views, stored procedures, and transaction control.
The project required restoring the Chinook database and executing a series of SQL queries to analyze sales data, customer activity, and musical preferences. It also involved creating a view combining customer and invoice details, proposing indexing strategies to optimize performance, analyzing transaction isolation levels, and developing a stored procedure to generate and update a statistics table with transactional safety and error handling.
